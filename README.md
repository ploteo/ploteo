Iâ€™m currently working on creating a suite of classroom economic experiments developed in [oTree](https://www.otree.org/) and analyzed in [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).

Visit my webpage for more details on my research activity.

I also enjoy graphical representations of quantitative data :bar_chart:.
